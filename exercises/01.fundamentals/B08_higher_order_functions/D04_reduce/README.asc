. Now we are going to create a new array of objects from the information below, where each object will have the format `{name: student name, average: average of grades}`. For this we will assume that the position 0 of `grades` refers to the student in position 0 of` students`, here in addition to `reduce` it will also be necessary to use the function` map`. Tip: You can access the index of the array inside `map`, and you can see the expected object in the` expected` constant.
