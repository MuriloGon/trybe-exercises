== Exercise Part 1 - Creating and Selecting things

The purpose of these exercises is to put into practice what you have just learned about DOM. Therefore, you must do the exercises using only JavaScript code, which must be inserted between the `<script>`:

. Add the `h1` tag with the text *Exercise 5.2 - JavaScript DOM* as a child of the `body` tag;
. Add the `div` tag with the `main-content` class as a child of the `body` tag;
. Add the `div` tag with the `center-content` class as a child of the `div` tag created in step 2;
. Add the p tag as a child of the `div` created in step 3 and add some text;
. Add the `div` tag with the `left-content` class as a child of the `div` tag created in step 2;
. Add the `div` tag with the `right-content` class as a child of the `div` tag created in step 2;
. Add an image with src set to `https://picsum.photos/200` and `small-image` class. This element must be a child of the `div` created in step 5;
. Add an unordered list with the values ​​from 1 to 10 in full as the list values. This list must be a child of the `div` created in step 6;
. Add 3 `h3` tags, all children of the `div` created in step 2.



== Exercise Part 2 - Changes and Removals

. Add the title class to the created `h1` tag;
. Add the description class to the 3 `h3` tags created;
. Remove the `div` created in step 5 (the one with the `left-content` class). Use the `.removeChild ()` function;
. Center the `div` created in step 6 (the one that has the `right-content` class). Tip: to centralize, just configure `margin-right: auto` do `div`;
. Change the background color of the parent element of the `div` created in step 3 (the one that has the `center-content` class) to `green`;
. Remove the last two elements (nine and ten) from the list created in step 8.
